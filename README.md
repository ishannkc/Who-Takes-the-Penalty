# ⚽ Who Takes the Penalty


![demo](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/26b4934c-3c5d-4c40-b81b-cc371c082894)


A fun, web-based **troll UI** that puts the user under pressure to decide who takes a crucial penalty.

Spoiler:  
You don’t really get a choice.  
The only valid answer is **Ronaldo** 🐐

## 🧠 Project Overview

**Who Takes the Penalty** is a playful front-end project designed to mess with user interaction. When a user tries to select **“Me”**, the button actively avoids being clicked by jumping to random positions on the screen.  

Eventually, the user is left with only one sensible and clickable option — **Ronaldo**.

## 🎮 How It Works

- Hover over **Me** → the button jumps to another position
- Try again → it jumps again
- Click **Ronaldo** → confirmation message appears
- Both buttons disappear after the correct choice

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **HTML** – Structure
- **CSS** – Styling & positioning
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)** – Button movement & event handling

No frameworks. No libraries. Pure front-end fundamentals.
