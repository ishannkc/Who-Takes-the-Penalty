A fun, web-based **troll UI** that puts the user under pressure to decide who takes a crucial penalty.

Spoiler:  
You don’t really get a choice.  
The only valid answer is **Ronaldo** 🐐

## 🧠 Project Overview

**Who Takes the Penalty** is a playful front-end project designed to mess with user interaction. When a user tries to select **“Me”**, the button actively avoids being clicked by jumping to random positions on the screen.  

Eventually, the user is left with only one sensible and clickable option — **Ronaldo**.

---

## 🎮 How It Works

- Hover over **Me** → the button jumps to another position
- Try again → it jumps again
- Click **Ronaldo** → confirmation message appears
- Both buttons disappear after the correct choice

Message shown:
> *“Smart choice. Leave the miracles to the man who makes them.”*

## 🛠 Tech Stack
