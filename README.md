# ⚽ Who Takes the Penalty


![demo](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/26b4934c-3c5d-4c40-b81b-cc371c082894)


A fun, web-based **troll UI** that puts the user under pressure to decide who takes a crucial penalty.

Spoiler:  
You don’t really get a choice.  
The only valid answer is **Ronaldo** 🐐

## 🧠 Project Overview

**Who Takes the Penalty** is a playful front-end project that creates an interactive troll UI experience. When users attempt to select **"Me"** to take the penalty, the button actively avoids being clicked by dynamically jumping to random positions across the screen.

After multiple attempts, users realize there's only one sensible and clickable option — **Ronaldo** 🐐. Upon selecting Ronaldo, the app fetches and displays a random inspirational quote from the legendary footballer.

## 🎮 How It Works

1. **Hover over "Me"** → The button detects your cursor and jumps to a random position
2. **Try again** → It keeps evading your attempts to click it
3. **Click "Ronaldo"** → A random inspirational quote from Ronaldo is fetched from the JSON data and displayed
4. **Success** → Both buttons disappear, revealing your wise choice

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **HTML** – Structure and markup
- **CSS** – Styling, animations, and positioning
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)** – Button movement, event handling, and interactivity
- **Fetch API** – Asynchronous data retrieval for dynamic quotes
- **JSON** – Data storage and quote management

No frameworks. No libraries. Pure front-end fundamentals.
